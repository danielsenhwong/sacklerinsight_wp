# sacklerinsight_wp
A WordPress-based blog for the Sackler InSight newsletter with a WP theme based on the InSight PDF theme.

The code basis for this theme is from Tania Rascia's blog post tutorial series on developing a WordPress theme from scratch: https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/

## Notes
GitHub repository uses the GitHub WordPress .gitignore file, so among other files, wp_config.php is not tracked. This is for security reasons, as this file contains the database settings, password, and site-specific security keys. This file will need to be re-generated when deployed.

Sackler InSight WP theme is located in wp-content/themes/sacklerinsight/.
