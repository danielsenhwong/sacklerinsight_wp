# sacklerinsight_wp
A WordPress-based blog for the Sackler InSight newsletter with a WP theme based on the InSight PDF theme.

## Notes
GitHub repository uses the GitHub WordPress .gitignore file, so among other files, wp_config.php is not tracked. This is for security reasons, as this file contains the database settings, password, and site-specific security keys. This file will need to be re-generated when deployed.
